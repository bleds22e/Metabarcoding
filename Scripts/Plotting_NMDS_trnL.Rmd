# Various Plotting Iterations of NMDS -- trnL data

```{r libraries and functions}
library(tidyverse)
source('functions.R')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
